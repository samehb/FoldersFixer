# FoldersFixer
## Introduction
Sometimes when you extract some archives you end up with folders ending with dots in their names. You try accessing those folders but you do not succeed. FoldersFixer allows you to rename Windows folders with trailing dots in order to access them.

## Usage
FoldersFixer has shell extension support. Here is what you need to do to fix your folders:

1. Download and execute [FoldersFixer](https://github.com/samehb/FoldersFixer/blob/master/Binaries/FoldersFixer.exe).
2. Go to the root folder that contains the problamatic folders (inside it) then right click it and click Fix Folders Names.

That is it. You do not have to execute FoldersFixer again unless you move it into another place than what you originally ran it in. That is because the program adds its location to the registry.

## Removal
Use the command line console (cmd.exe) to uninstall by navigating to the folder containing FoldersFixer.exe then entering and executing the following command
```
FoldersFixer.exe -unreg
```
Delete the FoldersFixer.exe file and you are done.
